# Missile-Attack-and-Defense-Simulation

Air defense systems are complex networks of interconnected subsystems tasked with protecting airspace and fighting aerial threats in the military defense domain. Similar to the high stakes seen in commercial aviation, these technologies hold enormous responsibility for saving lives and national security. Real-time systems (RTS), which process and respond to events in real time, are the primary technical way of implementing a comprehensive defense system. Real-time functionality is particularly significant in missile defense. The time available to notice a missile launch and perform a counter-tactical measure is usually limited; thus, immediate detection is critical. 

The primary goal of this project is to create a real-time military air defense system simulation using the Rust programming language, which captures the complexities of timely job execution, system predictability and reliability, and effective resource use. The investigation of the creation of such systems raises fundamental questions about the design factors that influence the delay between sensor detection and defensive response, as well as ways for improving system safety and dependability. Central concerns include the use of programming approaches that aim to reduce response times and improve overall system performance while also assuring resilience to unforeseen threats and hostile activities. 

Key Questions:

I.	How can using Rust concurrency characteristics improve the missile defense 
system's real-time responsiveness and effectiveness? 

II.	How do Rust's memory safety and error handling features improve defence system 
reliability and robustness against attacks and vulnerabilities?
